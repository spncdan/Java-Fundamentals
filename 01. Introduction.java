// Welcome to my self-learning Java repository
// I will be making notes here of my transition to understand Java after having learned core concepts of C++

/*
Java is a general-purpose * powerful programming language
It is used for developing software that will run on mobile, desktop, and servers.
Machine independent
*/

// Syntax Error: Doesn't follow Java Rules
// Semantic Error: Has No Meaning

/*
API - Application Programming Interface
API is a library which contains predefined Java code that we can use to develop Java programs
This makes the development process faster and easier as there is no need to write everything from scratch
*/

// Java (SE) is what will be used for this learning process (acts as foundation for all other editions)

/*
JDK - Java Development Kit
Set of programs that enable us to develop our programs
Contains JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is used to run our programs
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes our java programs on different machines (making it independent)
*/

/* IDE (integrated development environment) allows us to

    1. Write | Source Code
    2. Compile | Machine Code
    3. Debug | Tools to Find Errors
    4. Build | Files that can be executed by JVM
    5. Run | Execute program from within IDE

*/

// All of the above makes development faster and easier

/*
 Class - Blueprint to create Objects (Container of methods)
 Object - Instances of a Class
 Method - Groups of instructions to do specific tasks (Every method is written inside a class)
*/

// In Java, you end statements with ; similar to C++

/* the main() method is automatically called when we run our java program
 1. First method that is called
 2. Starting point of execution of our program
*/

/* Some important Java Access Keyword
- Public
- Private
- Protected
- Default
- Static
*/

/* Naming Conventions
Pascal Case Convention -> ThisIsAName (All first letters of word are capitalized) (Naming Classes)
Camel Case Convention -> thisIsAName (First letter of first word is not capitalized) (Naming Variables and Methods)
Snake Case Convention -> this_is_a_name
*/

// Structure of Java Program

// Class structures are as follows:
public class Main {

    // Method structures are as follows:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World"); // Outputting "Hello World" into the terminal
    }

}
