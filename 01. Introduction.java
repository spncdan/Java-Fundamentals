// Welcome to my self-learning Java repository
// I will be making notes here of my transition to understand Java after having learned core concepts of C++

// Java is a general-purpose * powerful programming language
// It is used for developing software that will run on mobile, desktop, and servers.
// Machine independent

// Syntax Error: Doesn't follow Java Rules
// Semantic Error: Has No Meaning

// API - Application Programming Interface
// API is a library which contains predefined Java code that we can use to develop Java programs
// This makes the development process faster and easier as there is no need to write everything from scratch

// Java (SE) is what will be used for this learning process (acts as foundation for all other editions)

// JDK - Java Development Kit
// Set of programs that enable us to develop our programs
// Contains JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is used to run our programs
// JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes our java programs on different machines (making it independent)

/* IDE (integrated development environment) allows us to

    1. Write | Source Code
    2. Compile | Machine Code
    3. Debug | Tools to Find Errors
    4. Build | Files that can be executed by JVM
    5. Run | Execute program from within IDE

*/

// All of the above makes development faster and easier

// Class - Blueprint to create Objects
// Object - Instances of a Class

// Class structures are as follows:

class class_name {
    // Code block - Code within brackets
}

// Method - are groups of instructions to do specific tasks

// Here is how you are able to Print "Hello World" in Java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
